# suburb_data_visualisation
Andy handover of heatmaps + other suburb data visualisation. 

Attached CSV files include the yield and growth of all Sydney suburbs obtained from the Pricefinder API. saving the need to send almost 500 requests to the API. 

Functionality of code:
<li>Displays heatmap of Sydney suburbs based on 2019 yield (darker hues represent higher yields)</li>
<li>Displays heatmap of Sydney suburbs based on 2018/2019 growth rates (green represents positive growth)</li>
<li>Displays current houses for sale in a select suburb on a choropleth map within the suburb boudary</li>
<li>Generates boxplot of suburb house prices from 2005 to 2019 for a select suburb</li>
<li>Generates list of all Sydney suburbs and whether they have positive or negative growth rates</li>

Refer to old files or supplementary file for some of my older work that led up to the final handover.
